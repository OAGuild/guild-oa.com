title: Try out Vampire servers
---

Hello, OpenArena.
New Vampire Guild [servers](/servers) are now available.
The concept is simple: you can increase your own health by dealing any damage.
For now, 25% of the damage you make is added to your health points.
Traditionally, there is one server with betting enabled and an ordinary one.
